# A Quest Board for my Dungeons and Dragons group

This a quest-board blog app that gives article entries as if they were quests. 

It utilizes a firestore database to store and delete quests. 
There are four fields: title, body, danger, and reward. 

Each quest page is draggable and has a button to show an expanded description. 
There also exists a danger level and reward sliders to display additional indecators on the board. 

In the header, there are the options to view all the quests, set a new quest and sign-in/out.

Here is a link to the firebase project: https://quest-board-76cfc.web.app/
